# Fibonacci Optimization Algorithm

This Go code demonstrates an optimization algorithm using the Fibonacci sequence to find the maximum value of a given function within a specified range.
Fibonacci Function

The fibonacci function calculates the Fibonacci sequence recursively. It takes an integer n as input and returns the n-th Fibonacci number. It serves as a helper function for the optimization algorithm.
Maximum Search Algorithm

The maxSearch function implements the optimization algorithm using the Fibonacci sequence. It takes the following parameters:

    f (function): The function to be optimized. It should accept a float64 parameter and return a float64 value.
    a (float64): The lower bound of the search interval.
    b (float64): The upper bound of the search interval.
    numIterations (int): The number of iterations to perform in the search.

The algorithm initializes the necessary variables and iterates using the Fibonacci sequence to find the maximum value. It uses the given function f to evaluate the function at each point and updates the search interval accordingly.

The maximum search algorithm terminates when the specified number of iterations is reached. It returns the maximum value found.
Main Function

The main function demonstrates the usage of the optimization algorithm. It defines the function f to be optimized, the search interval [a, b], and the number of iterations. It then performs the maximum search using the maxSearch function and prints the result.

You can modify the function f, the search interval, and the number of iterations to suit your specific problem. The algorithm will find the maximum value of the function within the given interval.
